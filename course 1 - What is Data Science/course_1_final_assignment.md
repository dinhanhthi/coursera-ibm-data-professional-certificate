# What is Data Science?

**Introduce yourself and share with your peers your background and any experience you have with data science. (1 mark)**

My name is Anh-Thi DINH. I'm from Vietnam and I'm a PhD in Applied Mathematics. I started to learn Data Science and Python at the end of 2018 with a course of Machine Learning by Andrew Ng and some open courses about Python. Parallel with them, I've also learned to be a Data Scientist on Dataquest and then took this course of IBM.

**Based on the videos and the reading material, how would you define a data scientist and data science? (3 marks)**

- Data Science is the study of data. How someone attempts to work with it and then uncover the insights and trends that are hiding behind it.
- Data Scientists are the ones who work in Data Science.They have background in Statistics, programming tools, structure of data,... to extract, manimulate, visualize,... the data and then they are able to answer some questions.

**As discussed in the videos and the reading material, data science can be applied to problems across different industries. What industry are you passionate about and would like to pursue a data science career in? (1 mark)**

There are different industries that Data Science can be applied. For example, medical fields, development new products, augmented reality, prediction,... In my opinion, I'm passionate about the way data can help us verify and predict the need of customers and give them the right answer automatically.

**Based on the videos and the reading material, what are the ten main components of a report that would be delivered at the end of a data science project? (5 marks)**

The 10 main components are: cover page (title, authors, publisher,...), table of contents (the bones of the report), introductory (give a big picture of a report, they're good for new reader), methodology (the technical part), results (what you obtain in the style of statistics, numbers, pictures,...), discussion (your comments for the report and its brothers), conclusion (review and talk about the future), references (clarify which ones are yours, which ones are not), acknowledgement (clearly you don't work alone) and appendices (detailed but not important things can be put here).
